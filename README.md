# Modex
## a model extractor for the Spin model checker

Modex can be used to mechanically 
extract verification models from implementation level C code.
first developed at Bell Labs starting in 1998, and released
as open-source in 2002.
The model extractor is guided by a user-defined test-harness,
specified in a separate file with extension ".prx".
The format used in test-harness files is documented
in the Manual.

For details on the theoretical background for the tool,
and its installation and use, see for instance
